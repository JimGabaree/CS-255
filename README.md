# CS-255
This project was made for a fictitious company called DriverPass. DriverPass is a corporation that helps teach learning drivers the rules of the road and aids them in becoming competent drivers.  The company contracted my group to create an online program that allowed their customers to login, register for courses, and make payments.  The main requirements were that the program be accessible anywhere, displayed courses, and allowed for reports to be generated for accountability. I feel like by design diagrams where decent in this project, but as with any project could have been more in depth. I generally start designing software by creating a Class Diagram once I have obtained the requirements from a customer. Defining requirements is key, and in this program, we had a fairly open transcript from the customer. It would have been much easier to talk to the client in person or be able to ask them questions. Every coder keeps their customerâ€™s needs, and users needs in mind. It is imperative that the end user is able to utilize the developed software while still keeping it completely functional. If the designed software is not good for the end user your group will constantly lose its clients due to developing useless projects.
